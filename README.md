# Pong (2-D Game)
Simple Mini Project i developed while learning the basics of PYTHON

<b>About :</b> Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the first sports arcade video game.
It is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The aim is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
</br></br>It is a classical example of ball physics and the concepts applied in this code can be reimplemented/used while developing a 2-D Game using any computer language on any IDE.
